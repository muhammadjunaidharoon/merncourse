    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p><b>Molly</b> had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, 
    lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific 
    journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite><u>On The Road</u></cite>. 
    It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in 
    these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an 
    Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing 
    better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets 
    of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly 
    <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
