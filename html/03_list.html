    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>

    <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich 
        scrambled eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center
              every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue
             to cook on the plate until served)</li>
    </ul>

                Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of 
                churned cream. It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature, 
                consisting of approximately 80% butterfat. It is used at room 
                temperature as a spread, melted as a condiment, and used as an 
                ingredient in baking, sauce making, pan frying, and other cooking 
                procedures.

                    Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed 
                    from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, 
                    the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. 
                    In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by
                    using centrifuges called "separators". In many countries, it is sold 
                    in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be 
                    dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high 
                    levels of saturated fat
